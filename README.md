# Bitcoin Trading Game Description
The Bitcoin Trading Game is a simple command-line based game that simulates buying and selling Bitcoin in a dynamic market environment. Players are given an initial balance in USD and can make decisions to buy or sell Bitcoin based on the current Bitcoin price. The objective of the game is to maximize the player's balance by making strategic decisions in buying and selling Bitcoin.

# Features:
Buy Bitcoin: Players can enter the amount of USD they want to invest in Bitcoin. The game calculates the corresponding amount of Bitcoin based on the current Bitcoin price and deducts the invested amount from the player's balance.

# Sell Bitcoin:
Players can choose to sell a portion of their Bitcoin holdings. They enter the amount of Bitcoin they wish to sell, and the game calculates the equivalent USD amount based on the current Bitcoin price. The USD amount is added to the player's balance.

# Check Balance:
Players can check their current balance in USD, the amount of Bitcoin they hold, and the current price of Bitcoin.

# Dynamic Market: 
The game simulates a dynamic market environment where the price of Bitcoin fluctuates. This adds an element of unpredictability, requiring players to adapt their trading strategies.

# How to Play:
